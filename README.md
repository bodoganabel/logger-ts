# logger-ts

A very basic logger script.
Collects console data to a buffer and writes them into log files.
Deletes old log files after a period of time.

Feel free to use, modify, etc... for small/hobby projects. (You can use it in projects of any size, but consider using a more supported library for commercial/big projects)
